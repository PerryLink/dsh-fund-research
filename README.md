## What is dsh-fund-research?

Deterministic research reports for Chinese public mutual funds, on DeepSeek Harness.

Every key number in every report traces back to a hashed source snapshot — gaps declared, never invented. Research only; not investment advice.

## Compatibility

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| DeepSeek Harness | `dsh-v0.2.1-rc.2` (peer range admits the alpha.2 line: `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.1.6-0 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.1.7-0 <0.2.0`). On this line `Session.append`'s third parameter is a `SurfaceIntent` for surface-eligible types only, so the `fund-research/*` audit events stay unappended (the tool results and sealed snapshot/report remain the audit trail). Verified 2026-09-24 (dual typecheck rulers + 176 tests). |
| Node.js | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` |
| Package manager | `pnpm@11.7.0` |
| Platform | Windows / macOS / Linux (host-only plugin) |
| Data sources | Tiantian Fund / Eastmoney public endpoints (no key, no login) |

## What you get

- **`fund_research` tool** — one fund code in, a versioned Markdown research report out: overview, performance decomposition, holdings penetration, simplified style attribution, manager profile, risk & gap declarations, disclaimer, and a **number-traceability appendix** mapping every key figure to its snapshot JSON path and verification verdict. Sealed to `fund-reports/{code}/{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}/` as `report.md` + `manifest.json` + `snapshot.json`. `background: true` runs it as a `fund-report` background job.
- **`fund_snapshot` tool** — a light snapshot card (latest NAV, published stage returns, scale, manager, top-3 holdings) sealed into the fund's day directory.
- **Deterministic metrics, zero model arithmetic** — period/annualized return, volatility, max drawdown, Sharpe; top-N concentration, HHI, industry distribution, quarter-over-quarter holdings comparison; size-value style bands; manager tenure and peer comparison. All pure functions over the sealed snapshot.
- **Traceability as a first-class feature** — before sealing, every key number is checked against the sealed `snapshot.json` through the optional [`dsh-data-quality`](https://github.com/topics/dsh-plugin) service when it is installed, or through the built-in isomorphic fallback checker (`builtin-fallback`) otherwise. The appendix table records value ↔ path ↔ verdict.
- **Honest gaps** — a failed or degraded data source produces an explicit data-gap declaration in the affected section. The plugin never fills a gap with an invented number.
- **Offline mode** — `offline: true` (config or tool argument) serves everything from the storage-domain snapshot layer or the newest on-disk version snapshot, with zero outbound requests. Ideal for tests and reproduction.
- **asOf cutoff** — `asOfDate` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`) truncates the NAV series to data on or before that date and stamps the snapshot + report with the cutoff; invalid or future dates fail loudly.
- **Checkpoint resume** — `<reportRoot>/.run-state.json` records each pipeline stage (snapshot/report) with timestamps and an input fingerprint; `resume: true` continues from the first incomplete stage, reusing sealed artifacts, and rejects a fingerprint mismatch.
- **Source discovery record** — every acquisition seals a code-generated `sources-discovery.json` (endpoint roster, primary/fallback resolution, per-source coverage and gaps, degradation reasons) and folds it into the report appendix as 数据源与缺口声明.
- **Multi-fund fan-out** — `codes` accepts an array of fund codes; each fund runs the pipeline independently with per-fund failure isolation (failures become summary gaps), and the result is a summary card (code / asOf / seal hash / verdicts / failure reason).
- **Tracking ledger** — every successful seal appends a deterministic line to `<reportRoot>/.tracking.jsonl`; `includeComparison: true` renders a deterministic 与上次对比 section (NAV range / scale / top holdings) with a gap declaration when no prior record exists.
- **Read-only review** — after sealing, a `fund-review` job reviews the sealed artifacts (gap-declaration completeness, traceability-table consistency, disclaimer) and writes `review-note.md`; it skips gracefully (recorded in run-state) when no jobs service is present.
- **Per-source quality signals** — every source carries deterministic quality metadata (`requested`/`succeeded`/`fieldsPresent`/`parseWarnings`/`degraded`), rendered in the appendix and surfaced in tool values so downstream can downweight (never hard-filter) a low-quality source.
- **Walk-forward stability summary** — `includeWalkForward: true` adds a 样本外稳定性摘要 section: deterministic rolling-window return/Sharpe sign persistence and mean/std, explicitly labelled as statistical description only, not a prediction.
- **Session audit events (host-dependent)** — `fund-research/snapshot` and `fund-research/report` log-only events carry the code, version directory, manifest hash, and gap list (model-visible ⟺ logged) *when the host admits out-of-repo event types*; on `0.1.2-alpha.1`–`0.1.5-alpha.1` hosts the known-type catalog is build-generated in-repo, so the gate appends nothing and the tool results plus sealed artifacts are the audit trail.
- **Methodology skill** — a bundled `fund-research` skill teaches the model the metric口径 (definitions), gap handling, and compliance wording. Computation stays in code.

## Quick start

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:PerryLink/dsh-fund-research
```

```text
> 用 fund_research 出一份 161725 的研究报告
```

The agent calls `fund_research({ code: "161725" })`; a minute later the workspace holds:

```text
fund-reports/161725/20260819-153012/
├── snapshot.json            # raw extracted data + computed metrics + per-source sha256
├── sources-discovery.json   # code-generated endpoint roster + coverage + gaps
├── report.md                # the research report with the traceability appendix
└── manifest.json            # snapshot/report hashes, parameters, verify engine, gaps
```

`.run-state.json` sits at the report root and records the pipeline stages for `resume: true`. Every number in `report.md`'s appendix carries a `verified` / `mismatch` / `not-found` / `unverifiable` verdict against `snapshot.json` — recompute any of them from `raw.*` with the documented口径 to audit the plugin itself.

## Permissions & data

- **Reads** the public Tiantian Fund / Eastmoney endpoints (`fund.eastmoney.com/pingzhongdata/*.js`, `fundf10.eastmoney.com` F10 pages, `push2.eastmoney.com` quotes) with a browser User-Agent and configurable polite pacing. No key, no login, no paid API, no anti-crawler circumvention.
- **Writes** only under the configured report root inside the session workspace, plus the `dsh_fund_research` storage domain (latest snapshot per fund).
- **Never** evaluates remote JavaScript (the pingzhongdata block is scanned, never executed), never stores credentials, never trades.
- Session events are log-only audit records that ride an adaptive gate in `src/events.ts`: they append only when the host admits an out-of-repo type — its known-type set covers the vocabulary, or its `Session.append` takes an `ignorable` envelope. From `0.1.2-alpha.1` on (including `0.1.5-alpha.1`) neither holds: `KNOWN_SESSION_EVENT_TYPES` is a build-generated in-repo catalog that excludes out-of-repo events by construction, and `Session.append` has no `ignorable` option, so the gate appends nothing — the tool results and sealed artifacts remain the reconstructable audit trail, and a failed append never changes a tool outcome.
- 0.1.5-alpha.1 (adapted 2026-09-09): re-verified the gate on the new baseline — the catalog still excludes out-of-repo events and `Session.append` still cannot stamp an `ignorable` envelope, so audit-gate behavior is unchanged.
- 0.1.5-rc.1 (adapted 2026-09-10): dependency pins move to the published 0.1.5-rc.1 line; no seam change affects this plugin's behavior.
- 0.1.5-rc.2 (adapted 2026-09-11): dependency pins move to the published 0.1.5-rc.2 line; no seam change affects this plugin's behavior.

## Security boundaries

- Fund codes are validated as exactly six digits before touching a path or a URL; the report root resolves inside the session workspace.
- Source payloads are hashed (SHA-256) at acquisition; the sealed manifest lets you detect silent upstream edits between runs.
- Verification never blocks a seal: a broken optional `dsh-data-quality` service degrades to the built-in checker, and the engine used is recorded in the manifest and the appendix.
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the reporting policy.

## Known limitations

- **Upstream structure drift.** The parsers are strict by design: if Tiantian Fund changes a `var Data_*` shape or an F10 table layout, the affected source throws a `SourceParseError` naming the field, and the section degrades to a declared gap (the core pingzhongdata block failing aborts the run loudly). This is deliberate — a silent misparse is worse than a declared gap.
- **Style attribution is估算口径.** Fixed size bands (≥1000亿 / 300–1000亿 / <300亿) and PE bands, plus within-holdings quintiles — no full-market distribution is consulted. The report labels this.
- **Holdings are quarterly disclosure data** (披露滞后); the F10 page carries the latest two quarters.
- **Single-`code` calls are one fund; `codes` is a fan-out over multiple funds.** No cross-fund portfolio analysis, no PDF annual reports, no real-time quotes (the `fundgz.1234567.com.cn` realtime endpoint is dead and deliberately unused).
- The Web UI "deliverables" turn row keys off mutation-tool call cards; this plugin's produced files surface through the tool call card's follow-along location (the fund's report directory), not per-file rows.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run typecheck:ci && pnpm run typecheck:checkout   # types, incl. CI-strict
pnpm test                                     # 176 tests over real harness seams
pnpm run test:e2e                              # opt-in LIVE-network E2E (LIVE_E2E=1)
pnpm run build && pnpm run verify:artifacts   # tsdown + tsc declarations
pnpm run verify:self-contained                # no out-of-repo dependency specs
node scripts/check-readme-sync.mjs            # five-language README gate
node scripts/check-endpoints.mjs              # M3 endpoint-liveness probe (4 eastmoney hosts)
pnpm pack                                     # tarball
```

Tests run the REAL `Context`/`SessionStore`/`ToolRuntime`/`LocalJobRegistry`/storage seam from the 0.1.7-rc.2 peers; the network is replaced only at the fetch boundary by saved real-response fixtures (`fixtures/`, fund 161725). Refresh fixtures with the collector scripts in `.tmp/`.
